# movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset-

1. **Description**: Mention that it is a movie recommender system implemented in Python using the Streamlit framework and content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity

2. **Dependencies**: List the dependencies required to run the code, including the `pickle`, `streamlit`, and `requests` libraries. You can specify the versions if necessary.

3. **Installation**: Provide instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies. For example, you can mention using `pip` to install the required packages: `pip install pickle streamlit requests`.

4. **Data**: Explain the data used in the recommender system. Mention that the movie data is stored in a pickle file (`movie_list.pkl`), which contains information about movies, and a similarity matrix pickle file (`similarity.pkl`), which represents the similarity between movies.

5. **Recommendation Algorithm**: Provide an overview of the recommendation algorithm used in the code. Explain that it calculates the similarity between movies based on some criteria (not specified in the code provided) and recommends similar movies to the user.

6. **Functions**: Describe the key functions used in the code. Briefly explain the purpose of each function, such as `fetch_poster`, which fetches the movie poster using the TMDb API, and `recommend`, which recommends similar movies based on user input.

7. **Usage**: Explain how to use the code. Describe that the user can select a movie from the dropdown menu and click the "Show Recommendation" button to view a list of recommended movies. Mention that the code will display the recommended movie titles and their corresponding posters.

8. **Data Sources**: If applicable, provide information about the data sources used in the code. Mention that the movie data and poster images are fetched from the TMDb API.

9. **Credits**: Acknowledge any external resources, libraries, or references that were used in the development of the code. Give credit to the original authors or sources of the recommender system algorithm and any other components used.

10. **Demo**: If available, provide a link to a live demo or a video demonstration of the movie recommender system in action.

11. **Contributing**: If you would like to invite others to contribute to the code, provide guidelines on how to contribute, including information on forking the repository and submitting pull requests.

12. **License**: Specify the license under which the code is released. Include any relevant license details or links.

13. **Contact**: Provide your contact information or ways for users to get in touch with you if they have questions, suggestions, or encounter any issues with the code.
